# Map-My-Major by SVC
### Goal
Our goal is to develop a system that will be able to give users a general course outline that they can follow to graduate within a given timeframe. We will take user input to be able to give the most accurate and most useful outline that we can provide. In order to prove this concept, we are going to start with the Computer Science major track.
